Hello, my name is Surya. 

Date: 5/11
What I accomplished specifically:
-Today, I was able to finish resolving issues with Apache Maven and external packages in order to install the Deeplearning4j library into Java. At the same time, I was able to download the necessary data (called the MNIST dataset) from online and convert the images into their proper format (PNG). Meanwhile, I explored file handling with java, specifically creating File, FileInputStream, and FileOutputStream objects which allow me to transport data into custom directories and  configure paths. I experimented with reading, creating, appending, and displacing text files so that in the future I could read the image data and place the images in a particular format to feed into the model.  
	
Comparison of what I did vs what I planned:
-I planned to set up Maven and add all the necessary dependencies for packages in Deeplearning4j. I was able to accomplish most of this today. I was able to import some of the required classes as planned. I was not able to set up my three main classes (Classifier, Main, and GUI), and I instead worked on downloading data, file handling, and fixing configuration issues. I wanted to make sure the data could be properly used for the model with little hesitancy.
Overally, little to no coding was done for the final project. I only experimented with file handling on my own to learn how to manage the data. 

What I plan to do next time:
-Next time, I plan to wrap up everything necessary to learn with data management and instead start implementing the main class for the model. In order to better manage my time, I plan to focus on what I know with java instead of staying stuck with whatever seems difficult to implement. I also plan on taking separate notes on classes, methods, and newly learned code in order to better remember and apply my skills more quickly to problems within this project. 

Personal Productivity Rating (0-5): 4
• 1 = I did nothing constructive
• 2 = I did some, but I also goofed off
• 3 = I did an average amount of work for my ability
• 4= I did an above average amount of work for my ability
• 5 = I did an awesome amount of work. I have never done more.

**No new coding was done for the project today.
